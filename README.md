# 🚢 Titanic Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Description  
This project is part of a **Data Analyst Internship Task (Task 5)**.  
The dataset used is the **Titanic dataset from Kaggle**, analyzed using **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)**.  

The main objective of this task was to perform **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to extract patterns, trends, and insights.  
The analysis includes **data cleaning, visualization, and statistical exploration** to understand survival factors.  

---

## Key tasks performed  

- Imported dataset into Jupyter Notebook.  
- Explored dataset structure with `.info()` and `.describe()`.  
- Checked **missing values** and handled them.  
- Performed **univariate analysis** (histograms, countplots).  
- Conducted **bivariate analysis** (survival vs. gender, class, age, etc.).  
- Used **correlation heatmap** to identify relationships between features.  
- Implemented **pairplot** to visualize multi-variable interactions.  
- Plotted **boxplots** to detect outliers (e.g., Fare).  
- Documented **key observations** from visualizations.

## 🛠️ EDA Steps  

### 1. Data Exploration  
- `.info()` → Checked data types and null values.  
- `.describe()` → Summarized numerical features.  
- `.value_counts()` → Analyzed categorical distribution.  

### 2. Data Visualization  
- **Univariate Analysis**  
  - Age distribution histogram  
  - Survival countplot  
  - Boxplot for Fare  

- **Bivariate Analysis**  
  - Survival by Gender  
  - Survival by Passenger Class  
  - Survival by Embarked port  

- **Multivariate Analysis**  
  - Heatmap (correlation)  
  - Pairplot (Age, Fare, Pclass vs Survived)
